# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a dance style dropdown to the app’s main screen and style the screen with a consistent creative theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a labeled dropdown on the main screen with exactly these options: Bollywood, Classical, Semi-classical, Indo Fusion.
- Show the currently selected dance style value on the screen (e.g., helper text below the dropdown) and update it when the user selects a different option.
- Apply a coherent visual theme (colors, typography, spacing, component styling) across the main screen and the dropdown section without adding new features.

**User-visible outcome:** On the main screen, the user can select a dance style from a dropdown and immediately see which style is currently selected in a clearly styled, consistent UI.
