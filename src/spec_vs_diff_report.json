  "generatedAt": "2026-02-06T10:09:44.742Z",
  "summary": "The diff applies a new CSS background utility class and attaches it to the app root, but it does not add the required generated image asset file. The diff also appears to introduce/modify UI content and broader theming changes that go beyond the request to only apply a background.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Add the generated background image(s) as static frontend assets under frontend/public/assets/generated with the exact filename(s) specified, and reference them from styling.",
      "reason": "No new files were added in the diff, so the required static asset `frontend/public/assets/generated/dance-background.dim_1920x1080.png` is not present. Without the file, the CSS reference risks a missing-asset build/runtime error.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: \"Added: 0\" / \"ADDED FILES: none\"",
        "frontend/src/index.css (references url('/assets/generated/dance-background.dim_1920x1080.png'))"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Add a dance-themed background to the main page that includes both Bollywood and Bharatanatyam elements behind existing content without changing functionality.",
      "reason": "While styling is added to apply a background behind content, the actual required image asset is not included in the diff, so the background cannot be confirmed to load or to contain the specified Bollywood+Bharatanatyam visual cues.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css (background-image points to /assets/generated/dance-background.dim_1920x1080.png)",
        "File diff summary: \"Added: 0\" / \"ADDED FILES: none\""
      ]
    }
  ],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Addition/expansion of a dance style selector UI (dropdown, helper text, and conditional info cards) rather than only applying a background.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states non-goals: no new UI features beyond applying the requested background. The diff shows substantial UI logic and content in App.tsx (state, Select dropdown, conditional text/cards).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (adds useState selectedStyle, Select dropdown, helper text \"Currently selected:\", and conditional content blocks)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Global theme/palette changes (OKLCH variables for warm palette; dark mode adjustments) beyond the requested background application.",
      "reason": "The request focuses on adding a background image and ensuring readability via overlay/opacity/blur, but the diff also changes many global CSS variables for colors and charts, which is broader than necessary for the background requirement.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css (:root and .dark blocks redefine many design tokens like --primary, --chart-1..5, etc.)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Tailwind configuration extensions (custom border radius, shadows, Inter font family).",
      "reason": "Not requested; the change summary indicates Tailwind config was modified to support a cohesive design system, which is outside the scoped request to apply a background only.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions modifications to frontend/tailwind.config.js)"
      ]
