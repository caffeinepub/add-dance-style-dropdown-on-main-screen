  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented via a labeled Select dropdown on the main screen with the four specified dance styles, selection state reflected in UI, and a consistent themed layout/colors. However, the diff also introduces authentication/Internet Identity infrastructure, an actor hook, and extra informational content not requested and potentially outside the stated non-goals.",

      "description": "Introduces Internet Identity authentication provider/context and related hooks (login/identity handling), which is explicitly out of scope (non-goal: no authentication changes).",
